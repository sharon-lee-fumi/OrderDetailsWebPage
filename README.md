# OrderDetailsWebPage
Order Details Web Page uses ListBox to display the categories. When a category is selected, its corresponding products are loaded in the DropDownList. When a product is selected, its corresponding order details are loaded in the GridView. If a new category is selected from the ListBox, update the products DropDownList accordingly. If a new product is selected from the DropDownList, update the order details GridView accordingly. Use AJAX to fetch the data and update the controls.
